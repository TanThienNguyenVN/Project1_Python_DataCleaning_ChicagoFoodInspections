    "### Motivation\n",
    "- In this notebook, I will practice the basics of Python using Python's built-in data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples and sets using an online tutorial video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VSAsKAj98 made by David Beazley at the talk from the 2016 PyData Conference in Chicago, USA as a reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This basic notebook will help me to see how Python can be used to automate powerful data manipulations with quite big data source excel file (~250MB)\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are some changes being made to retrieve more information."
