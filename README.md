### Project1: Basic Data Cleaning in Python using Chicago Food Inspections dataset
- In this notebook, I will practice the basics of Python using Python's built-in data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples and sets using an online tutorial video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VSAsKAj98 made by David Beazley at the talk from the 2016 PyData Conference in Chicago, USA as a reference.

- This basic notebook will help me to see how Python can be used to automate powerful data manipulations with quite big data source excel file (~250MB)

- There are some changes being made to retrieve more information
